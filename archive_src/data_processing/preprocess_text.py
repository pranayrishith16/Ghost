Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia, at Clarksburg. Irene M. Keeley, Senior District Judge. (1:17-cr-00027-IMK-MJA-3) Submitted: December 19, 2019 Decided: January 14, 2020 Before KEENAN, DIAZ, and RICHARDSON, Circuit Judges. Affirmed by unpublished per curiam opinion. Britney Joyce Robinson, Appellant Pro Se. Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit. 2 PER CURIAM: Britney Joyce Robinson appeals the district court\u2019s order denying her motion under Section 602 of the First Step Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-391, 132 Stat. 5194. We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of its authority under the First Step Act. United States v. Venable, 943 F.3d 187, 192 (4th Cir. 2019). Moreover, we may \u201caffirm on any ground appearing in the interpretation of its authority under the First Step Act. United States v. Venable, 943 F.3d 187, 192 (4th Cir. 2019). Moreover, we may \u201caffirm on any ground appearing in the record, including theories not relied upon or rejected by the district court.\u201d United States v. Flores-Grandaos, 783 F.3d 487, 491 (4th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court did not err in denying Robinson\u2019s request for an order to be placed in home confinement or a halfway house because she is not eligible for such relief under the statute, as amended by the First Step Act. See 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3624(c) (2015 & Supp. 2019). The district court correctly concluded that it lacked authority under the First Step Act to order a split sentence. See United States v. Wirsing, 943 F.3d 175, 183-86 (4th Cir. 2019). Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process. AFFIRMED - 804 - Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets 304 Nebraska Reports EDDY v. BUILDERS SUPPLY CO. Cite as 304 Neb. 804 Wanda Eddy, appellant, v. Builders Supply Company, Inc., appellee. ___ N.W.2d ___ Filed January 17, 2020. No. S-18-800. 1. Workers\u2019 Compensation: Appeal and Error. Pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 48-185 (Cum. Supp. 2018), an appellate court may modify, reverse, or set aside a Workers\u2019 Compensation Court decision only when (1) the compensation court acted without or in excess of its powers; (2) the judgment, order, or award was procured by fraud; (3) there is not sufficient competent evidence in the record to warrant the making of the order, judgment, or award; or (4) the findings of fact by the compensa\u00ad tion court do not support the order or award. 2. ____: ____. On appellate review, the factual findings made by the trial judge of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court have the effect of a jury ver\u00ad dict and will not be disturbed unless clearly wrong. 3. Workers\u2019 Compensation: made by the trial judge of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court have the effect of a jury ver\u00ad dict and will not be disturbed unless clearly wrong. 3. Workers\u2019 Compensation: Judgments: Appeal and Error. In testing the sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings of fact in a work\u00ad ers\u2019 compensation case, an appellate court considers the evidence in the light most favorable to the successful party, every controverted fact must be resolved in favor of the successful party, and the appellate court gives the successful party the benefit of every inference reasonably deducible from the evidence. 4. Workers\u2019 Compensation: Pretrial Procedure. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s authority to enforce compliance with reasonable discovery is as broad as that of any trial court in Nebraska. 5. Evidence: Appeal and Error. Generally, the control of discovery is a matter for judicial discretion, and decisions regarding discovery will be upheld on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion. 6."
