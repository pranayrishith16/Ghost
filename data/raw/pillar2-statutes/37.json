In clauses (1) and (2), the word “officer” is substituted for the words “commissioned officer, commissioned warrant officer, warrant officer” to conform to the definition of “officer” in section 101(11) of this revised title. In clause (1), the words “Regular or Reserve component” are omitted, since, under the definition of “reserve component” in section 102(k) of the source statute, those words are defined to include members without component status. Together, these categories compose the entire structure of any uniformed service.

In clause (4), the words “as it existed at any time before” are inserted for clarity, since the reference is intended to apply to the corps established by law before. Service in the Army Nurse Corps or Navy Nurse Corps now existing would be included under clause (1) or (2), since there is now no legal distinction between the service of nurses and that of other members of the Army and Navy. In clause (6), the date “,” is substituted for the words “the effective date of this section,” to reflect laws enacted after that effective date which authorized certain service to be credited for pay purposes. See, for example,. Clause (9) is substituted for section 233(b) (less proviso) of existing title 37. The last sentence is substituted for section 233(b) (proviso) of existing title 37."

										"p": "The words “on active duty (other than for training)” are substituted for the words “on the active . . . list” to conform to longstanding administrative construction, and because there is no “active list” in the case of many of the uniformed services named, but only for certain regular component of those services, e.g., the “Regular Army” and the “Regular Air Force”. The words “a retired list of that service” are substituted for the words “retired list”, since there is more than one retired list for many of the services named. (See sections 1376, 3966, and 8966 of title 10, for example.)
